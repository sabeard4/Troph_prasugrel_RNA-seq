# Transcriptomic analysis of RNA from primary trophoblasts treated with prasugrel *in vitro*

This site contains the analysis of RNA-seq data generated from primary cytotrophoblast cells isolated from seven term placentas and cultered *in vitro* for 24 hours in the presence of 100uM prasugrel and vehicle control. Gene expression differences were investigated between treated and untreated cells.

Details of the analysis can be found [here][]

A [workflowr][] project.
